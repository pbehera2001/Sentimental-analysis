## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is a crucial task in understanding opinions expressed in text data. This project demonstrates how to preprocess text data, analyze sentiment, and classify the sentiment of various sentences using Python libraries.

## Dataset

The project uses a predefined list of example sentences for sentiment analysis. You can modify the `text_data` variable in the code to analyze different sentences.

### Example Sentences

- "I absolutely love this product, it has transformed my life!"
- "The new design is okay, but I expected something more innovative."
- "I had a horrible experience with the customer service."
- "This brand really understands what customers want. Highly recommended!"
- "The product is decent but nothing special."
- "I'm never buying from this company again, totally disappointed."
